# 🧠 CCNP / CML Labs

This repository contains my personal **Cisco Modeling Labs (CML)** projects — practical implementations from the **CCNP ENCOR** and **ENARSI** journey.  


Each folder contains:
- `*.yaml` — ready-to-import CML topology file  
- `*_config.txt` — sanitized device configurations  
- `topology.png` — topology screenshot  
- `README.md` — description, goals, verification checklist 

## 🔍 How to Use

1. Open **Cisco Modeling Labs** (CML).  
2. Import the `.yaml` file of the desired lab.  
3. Boot all nodes and apply sanitized configs from `.txt` files.  
4. Follow the checklist in the lab’s `README.md` to verify results.  
5. Observe behavior, analyze convergence, and take notes.

## 🧾 Notes

- All configurations are **sanitized** for public sharing.  
- No passwords, keys, or private data are included.  
- Topologies are designed for educational and demonstration purposes.
